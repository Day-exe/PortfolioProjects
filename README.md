  A project comissioned by my counselor, Ms. Howard. The goal is to make a program that can break recipies down into smaller batches.

### Note: Due to unfortunate circumstances, I had to abandon the original repository for this. You can find it and the commit messages that show my progress up until this point [here](https://github.com/Day-exe/Portfolio-Projects)

# About The Author
All projects written by Day (no, that is not my real name).\
I have been writing programs since around 2020. My first language was C++ which I learned from Michael Reeves' videos, who was my initial inspiration for learning to write code. I later learned how to write in Java at the local community college which is the language that I use now. I am a student of the Information Technology Oracle Academy (ITOA) and am currently in high school (grad year of 2026). All of the projects in this portfolio were written for my Internship class as part of the ITOA program. I also write, do taekwondo, and enjoy spending time outside.
