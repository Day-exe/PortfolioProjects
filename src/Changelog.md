## v0.1
 - Incomplete
 - Doesnt work
 - Very basic
 - Missing many features I would like to add

## v0.2
 - Finished
 - Code should work now. Still need to debug. Getting an odd error with VSC not being able to find the class
 - Added user sign in
 - Added persistance
 - Added a way to convert the result back to a fraction, a major issue with the previous version since I don't think most people want to read and try to interpret a decimal with digits that repeat infinitely.
 - Other stuff that I cant remember (I have memory issues, sue me.)
